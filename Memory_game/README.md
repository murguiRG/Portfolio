# First functional version of the Memory Game

## What you should expect:

- Clicking on any card should execute the **flipCards** function
- The **flipCards** function doesn't allow more than two cards to be flipped at a time.
  It flips them back if they're different.
- Found pairs remain flipped showing their content
- **ctrl + R** or the refresh button should execute the **dealCards** function
