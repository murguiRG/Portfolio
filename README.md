Hi, my name is Regi and this is my room, where I'll be myself and code whatever I want!! Feel free to check out my projects and give supportive feedback in any way you can!! I believe development can be made easier and friendlier by just being open enough to share your achievements and great ideas with other people, so that they can get inspired and never lose the hunger for growth! 🌱🍄

Here I'll be uploading the latest versions of all my personal proyects as I keep adding features and updating them across time. Hope you find them as cool as I do and enjoy testing them as well!! ✨💕

See you around! ~ (╹ڡ╹ )
